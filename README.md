Scripts and stuff I made for my undergrad research lab!
Credit me if you want :)

Notes:
I have just realized that a lot of this is coded specifically to work with UNIX systems, so if you have a Windows computer you might have to rewrite some of the paths to files and such. Sorry, I'll be more aware of it in any of the code I make going forward, but I don't have all the time in the world to fix it currently.
